Basic Cryptography
======================

> Security through obscurity is a _fallacy_!

- _substitution cipher_ ~ Cesarean cipher
- _XOR cipher_ - XOR with some repeated "combinator"
- _diffusion_ - small change in plaintext â†’ large change in ciphertext
- _confusion_ - key/cleartext doesn't relate in simple way to ciphertext
- _non-repudiation_ - proves that a user performed an action
- _plaintext_ - data that is to be encrypted
- _cleartext_ - data that has not yet been encrypted

> Resource vs. Security Constraint

- low-power devices need security
- crypto needs to work for devices with low-latency
- Energy, Latency, Security all fight in a trifecta

thus, there needs to be _high resiliency_ in crypto

Four basic protections of crypto:

- Authenticity
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Non-Repudiation

## Crypto Algorithms

- Stream Cipher - one character and replaces with another
- Block Cipher - entire block at a time
- Sponge Function - expansion of plaintext to larger ciphertext

### Hashing

- Fixed Size
- Unique
- Original
- Secure

| SHA-2       | 128 (9 r), 192 (11 r), 256 (13 r) | Secure                |
| SHA-3       |                                   | Latest SHA, Low-Power |
| RIPEMD      | 128, 256, 320                     | Parallel              |
| HMAC        |                                   | Shared Key            |

### Symmetric Key Crypto

> Private Key Cypto, Shared Key Crypto

- comparatively fast
- few computational requirements

| Algorithm | Type   | Length                   | Traits                  |
| :-------- | :----- | :----------------------  | :---------------------- |
| DES       | Block  | 56b Key                  | Not Secure              |
| 3DES      | Block  | Can use 3 keys           | 3 rounds of DES         |
| AES       | Block  | 128b plaintext, 192, 256 | NIST in 2000, Secure    |
| RC-4 + BR | Stream | 56b, 128b Key            | Voice, Video, Streaming |
| Rivest    |        |                          |                         |
| Twofish   |        |                          |                         |
| Blowfish  | Block  | 64b blocks, 32-448 keys  | No significant weakness |
| IDEA      | Block  | 64b blocks, 128b Key     | 8 Rounds, EU            |

#### Modes of Operation

> What if two blocks have the same plaintext? You would see the same blocks of ciphertext

- Electronic Code Book (ECB)
- Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
- Cipher Feedback Mode (CFM)
- Output Feedback Mode (OFM)
- Counter Mode (CTR)

### Asymmetric Key Cypto

> Public Key Crypto

| Algorithm | Traits                                   |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| RSA       | Prime Numbers, 1997 MIT, Most Common     |
| ECC       | Elliptic Curve, Less Power, Smaller Keys |
| DSA       | Digital Signatures, U.S. Fed Standard    |

- _perfect forward secrecy_ - random public keys for each session

### Key Exchange

> Diffie-Hellman

- DH
  - Uses same keys each time
  - agree on large prime number and related integer
- DH Ephemeral
- Elliptic Curve DH

## Attacks

- Knowledge of underlying plaintext language - i.e. English
- Distribution of characters - tons of E, little use of Q
- Null ciphertext - null value padding
- Management Frames - TCP/IP has a structure
- Collision Attack
- Birthday Attack

## File System Encryption

- EFS - Microsoft Windows Encrypting File System - NTFS
- Full Disk Encryption - BitLocker
- Hardware Encryption - trusted platform module, hardware security model
  - password-protected flash drives
  - self-encrypting drives (SED)
  - TPM - true random numbers & other crypto services, built in motherboard / hardware
  - HSM - onboard keygen and storage
