Basic Cryptography
======================

> Security through obscurity is a _fallacy_!

- _substitution cipher_ ~ Cesarean cipher
- _XOR cipher_ - XOR with some repeated "combinator"
- _diffusion_ - small change in plaintext â†’ large change in ciphertext
- _confusion_ - key/cleartext doesn't relate in simple way to ciphertext
- _non-repudiation_
  - proves that a user performed an action
  - private keys are never seen by others, if so, they're revoked
  - "actions that are signed cannot be repudiated by the holder"; _they_ signed it
- _plaintext_ - data that is to be encrypted
- _cleartext_ - data that has not yet been encrypted
- _ephemeral keys_ - keys used only once
- _perfect forward secrecy_ - key derived from another isn't compromised, if the parent is
- _differential cryptanalysis_ - compares plaintext to ciphertext to determine the key
- _linear cryptanalysis_ - uses a simplified cipher to generate new ciphertext from plaintext, and compares to actual ciphertext to better estimate key
- _key stretching_ - the act of increasing the keyspace of a cipher, usually through multiple rounds
- _key exchange_ - the act of sharing a secret key - implementations can use asymmetric encryption to share, or derive it with DH
- _Rainbow Tables_ - lookup table for hashed data - salting renders them ineffective

> Resource vs. Security Constraint

- low-power devices need security
- crypto needs to work for devices with low-latency
- Energy, Latency, Security all fight in a trifecta

thus, there needs to be _high resiliency_ in crypto

Four basic protections of crypto:

- Authenticity
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Non-Repudiation

## Crypto Algorithms

- Stream Cipher - one character and replaces with another
- Block Cipher - entire block at a time
- Sponge Function - expansion of plaintext to larger ciphertext

### Hashing

- Unique
- Original
- Secure

#### Modes of Operation

> What if two blocks have the same plaintext? You would see the same blocks of ciphertext

- Electronic Code Book (ECB)
  - Simplest, each block is encrypted separately
- Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
  - XOR with previous block, IV for first cipher
  - Cannot be parallelized
- Cipher Feedback Mode (CFM)
- Output Feedback Mode (OFM)
- Counter Mode (CTR / CTM)
  - generates nonce for each block
  - encrypts nonce, then XOR with plaintext
  - Can be parallelized

### Diffie-Hellman

- DH Groups
  - the keyspace, basically
- DH
  - Uses same keys each time
  - agree on large prime number and related integer
- DH Ephemeral
  - aka Ephemeral Diffe-Hellman (EDH / DHE)
  - key generated used only once (popular for session keys)
  - provides perfect forward secrecy
- Elliptic Curve DH (ECDH)
  - Works with ECC
  - Ephemeral variant ECDHE

### Key Stretching

| Algorithm | Traits        |
| :-------- | :------------ |

## Attacks

- Knowledge of underlying plaintext language - i.e. English
- Distribution of characters - tons of E, little use of Q
- Null ciphertext - null value padding
- Management Frames - TCP/IP has a structure
- Collision Attack
- Birthday Attack
- Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE)
  - CBC attack
  - change in one bit of ciphertext block causes next block to be whacked, with bit inverted, and rest of the blocks good-to-go

## File System Encryption

- EFS - Microsoft Windows Encrypting File System - NTFS
- Full Disk Encryption - BitLocker
- Hardware Encryption - trusted platform module, hardware security model
  - password-protected flash drives
  - self-encrypting drives (SED)
  - TPM - true random numbers & other crypto services, built in motherboard / hardware
  - HSM - onboard keygen and storage
