Access Management
=====================

> IAAAA - Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Access, Accounting

- _Object_ - resource
- _Subject_ - a user, or function acting on behalf of a user
- _Operation_ - the action taken by a subject, over an object

- _Privacy Officer_ - oversees privacy compliance
- _Custodian or Steward_ - reviews security settings and makes audit trails
- _Owner_ - person responsible for the information
- _End user_ - person who accesses the information

## Accounts

Types of Accounts:

- User Accounts
- Service Accounts
- Privileged Accounts

### Initial Set-Up

- Employee Accounts
- Location Based Settings
- Standard Naming Conventions
  - aclark, athan.clark, clarkaem, clark.al.aem
- Time-Of-Day Restrictions
- Enforcing Least-Privilege
- Routine Auditing
  - Recertification
  - Permission auditing & review
  - Usage auditing & review

### Offboarding

- Backup of employee's data
- Archive email & hide record in address book
- _orphaned_ vs. _dormant_

## Access Control Model

> Properly configuring accounts is first step in security

| Name    | Explanation                                 | Description                           |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------ | :----------                           |
| MAC     | End user cannot set controls                | Most restrictive                      |
| DAC     | Subject has total control over objects      | Least restrictive                     |
| RBAC    | Assigns users and objects to role hierarchy | Real-World                            |
| RB-RBAC | Dynamically assigns roles based on rules    | Managing user access to multi-systems |
| ABAC    | Uses policies that can combine attributes   | Most flexible                         |


### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

- Least Restrictive
- Every Object has an Owner
- Owners have total control
- Owners can give permission to subjects
- Used in operating systems

#### Weakness

- Relies on decisions of end user to set proper security
- Security permissions are inherited by processes

### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

- Most restrictive - has no control to change security policy
- Military settings
- _Labels_ - every object is assigned a classification label, subjects assigned a clearance label
- _Levels_ - hierarchy of labels
- major implementations: Lattice Model, Bell-LaPadula Model
  - In Bell-LaPadula, subjects may not create objects or perform operations on lower level objects
- Windows uses Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC)
  - User Access Control (UAC) and security ids (SID)

### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

> Non-Discretionary Access Control

- Access permissions are based on user's job function
- i.e. user groups

### Rule Based Access Control

> Rule-Based Role-Based Access Control (RB-RBAC)

- Dynamically assigns roles to subjects based on a set of rules set by custodian
- Used for managing system access to one or more systems - business changes → rule changes → access changes

### Attribute-Based Access Control

- Most flexible
- More flexible policies than RB-RBAC - can combine policies
- Policies can take advantage of object, subject, and environment attributes
- Can be formatted with control flow (`if .. else`)

## Best Practices for Access Control

### Separation of Duties

> Two keys at opposite ends of a room to launch nuke

If necessary process was operated fraudulently could cause catastrophic failure,
then distribute operation of process to two or more parties

### Job Rotation

- Move individuals between job responsibilities
- Limits time for committed fraud, exposes avenues for fraud
- Reduces employee "burnout"

### Mandatory Vacations

- Limits fraud, because perp needs to be present
- Audits usually scheduled during absence

### Clean Desk Policy

> Ensures all confidential and sensitive material is secured when not in use

- computers are locked and turned off at end of day
- confidential documents are locked in desk
- keys for file cabinets are properly maintained
- use of locking cables

## Implementing Access Control

- ACL is attached to objects - system checks object ACL when subject performs operation
  - file permissions, SQL and relational databases
- Each _entry_ - ACE
- ACE Windows structure:
  - SID for user, group, or logon session
  - Access mask specifies access rights controlled by ACE
  - Flag indicates type of ACE (allow / deny)
  - Flags indicating inheritance of permissions (i.e. by folder structure)

### Group-Based Access Control

> Configures multiple computers by single security policy

- Windows Group Policy for users of Active Directory, settings stored in Group Policy Objects
  - Local Group Policy - fewer options, not for AD
  - _Software Restrictive Policies_ - employed by group policies, per-machine
  - _User Account Level Control_ - Enforced via AppLocker; per-user
  
### Identity and Access Services

| Feature                        | RADIUS      | TACACS+   |
| :----------------------------- | :---------- | :-------- |
| Transport Protocol             | UDP         | TCP       |
| Authentication & Authorization | Combined    | Separate  |
| Communication                  | Unencrypted | Encrypted |
| Kerberos?                      | Nope        | Yep!      |
| Network Devices?               | Nope :(     | Yep!      |

#### RADIUS

> Remote Authentication Dial In User Service

- 1992
- Client typically a wireless AP
- Typically users are stored in central DB
- Advantages: Increased security due to single audit trail, easier billing and network stats
- XFINITY remote login?
- IEEE 802.1x port security

#### Kerberos

- Developed at MIT
- Crypto tickets
- Like using a driver's license to cash a check

#### Terminal Access Control Access Control Systems+ (TACACS+)

- Similar to RADIUS
- commonly used on UNIX
- central server
- current version is TACACS+

#### Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

- Information about users and network devices
- Network resources and users' privileges to those resources
- **X.500** → defines DAP
- TCP/IP subset of DAP, simpler than X.500
- LDAPS - over SSL/TLS
- Susceptible to LDAP injection attacks (like SQL injection when input isn't sanitized)

#### Security Assertion Markup Language

- XML, allows web domains to exchange user auth data
- used in e-commerce business-to-business and business-to-customer transactions
- 3rd party identity providers

#### Authentication framework protocols

More secure alternative to:

- Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
- MS-CHAP
- Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)

> Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

- Four packets - Request, Response, Success, Failure
