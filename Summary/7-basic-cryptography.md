Basic Cryptography
======================

> Security through obscurity

- _substitution cipher_ ~ Cesarean cipher
- _XOR cipher_ - XOR with some repeated "combinator"
- _diffusion_ - small change in plaintext â†’ large change in ciphertext
- _confusion_ - key doesn't relate in simple way to ciphertext
- _non-repudiation_ - proves that a user performed an action

> Resource vs. Security Constraint

- low-power devices need security
- crypto needs to work for devices with low-latency
- Energy, Latency, Security all fight in a trifecta

thus, there needs to be _high resiliency_ in crypto

## Crypto Algorithms

- Stream Cipher - one character and replaces with another
- Block Cipher - entire block at a time
- Sponge Function - expansion of plaintext to larger ciphertext

### Hashing

- Fixed Size
- Unique
- Original
- Secure

| Algorithm   | Length        | Traits                |
| :---------- | :-------      | :-------              |
| MD5         | 512b          | Collisions, Weak      |
| SHA-2       | 128, 256, 512 | Secure                |
| SHA-3       |               | Latest SHA, Low-Power |
| RIPEMD      | 128, 256, 320 | Parallel              |
| HMAC        |               | Shared Key            |

### Symmetric Key Crypto

> Private Key Cypto, Shared Key Crypto

| DES       | 56b Key                 | Block Cipher            |
| 3DES      | Can use 3 keys          | 3 rounds of DES         |
| AES       | 128b plaintext          | NIST in 2000, Secure    |
| Rivest    |                         |                         |
| Blowfish  | 64b blocks, 32-448 keys | No significant weakness |
| IDEA      | 64b blocks, 128b Key    | 8 Rounds, EU            |

### Asymmetric Key Cypto

> Public Key Crypto

| Algorithm | Traits                                   |
| RSA       | Prime Numbers, 1997 MIT, Most Common     |
| ECC       | Elliptic Curve, Less Power, Smaller Keys |
| DSA       | Digital Signatures                       |

### Key Exchange

> Diffie-Hellman

- DH Ephemeral
- Elliptic Curve DH

## Attacks

- Knowledge of underlying plaintext language - i.e. English
- Distribution of characters - tons of E, little use of Q
- Null ciphertext - null value padding
- Management Frames - TCP/IP has a structure
- Collision Attack
- Birthday Attack

## File System Encryption

- EFS - Microsoft Windows Encrypting File System - NTFS
- Full Disk Encryption - BitLocker
- Hardware Encryption - trusted platform module, hardware security model
  - password-protected flash drives
  - self-encrypting drives (SED)
  - TPM - true random numbers, built in motherboard
  - HSM - onboard keygen and storage
