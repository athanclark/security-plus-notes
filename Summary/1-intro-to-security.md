Intro to Security
=====================

> How does security relate to information security?

Security: _to be free from danger, and the process to achieving that goal_.

- As security increases, convenience often decreases

Information security: _securing information in a digital format_.

- _maniupulated data_ - data-in-use
- _preserved data_ - data-at-rest
- _transmitted data** - data-in-transit

#### Goal

To ward off attacks, & prevent total collapse when an attack is successful.

**Purpose:**

- _prevent_ data theft
- _thwart_ identity theft
- avoid _legal consequences_ of not securing information
- maintain _productivity_
- _foiling_ cyber-terrorism

#### Roles

- _Security Administrator_: Analyze and design security solutions as well as identifying users' needs
  - does **NOT** report directly to the CIO
- _Security Manager_: Reports directly to the CISO, and supervises technicians, admins, and security staff
- _Security Analyst_:
  - Job growth to be 18% by 2024
- _Security Technician_: Entry-level position
- CSO
- CIO
- CSIO

---------------------------------

Three types of **information protection**:

- _Confidentiality_ - access via approval
- _Integrity_ - correct & unaltered
- _Availability** - authorized access

**Security Layers**:

- Information
  - Processed
  - Stored
  - Transmitted
- Traits
  - Confidentiality
  - Integrity
  - Availability
- Layers
  - Products
  - People
  - Policies & Procedures
  
- _Products_ form the actual security mechanism for the data
- _People_ implement and use the products to protect the data
- _Policies & Procedures_ maintain the proper use of products

> An immediate solution that cuts through the complexity of a problem is called a _"silver bullet"**

**Technical Controls**: The process of using technology as a basis for controlling usage and access to sensitive data.

### 5 Fundamental Security Principals

- _Layering_ - most comprehensive, "defense-in-depth"
- _Limiting_ - file permissions, or controlling human behavior via policy
- _Diversity_ - layers must be from different vendors - "vendor diversity"
- _Obscurity_ - not revealing any details about products used
- _Simplicity_ - hardened designs, like a 50 cal

- industry standard frameworks and reference architectures give broad guidance about a security framework
  - regulatory frameworks are required by external agencies
  - industry-specific frameworks address a particular sector; i.e. finance vs. power grid
  - some are globally designed, others specific to a region
  - Common frameworks include ISO, COBIT, RFC (FIXME)
  
> Information security **protects and establishes** CIA on devices that
> _store, process, and transmit_ data; by using _products, people, and procedures._

--------------------------------

- _Asset_: item that has value
- _Threat_: type of action that has potential to cause harm
- _Threat Actor_: person (or element) with power to carry out a threat
- _Vulnerability_: flaw or weakness that allows threat actor to bypass security
- _Attack / Threat Vector_: means by which an attack can occur
- _Risk_: situation that involves exposure to danger
- _Likelihood_: probability that vulnerability is exploited

-------------------------------

### Risk Response Techniques

- _Accept_ - do nothing to address the risk
- _Transfer_ - make 3rd party deal with it
- _Avoid_ - don't involve yourself in the actions that exposed yourself to the risk
- _Mitigate** - address and reduce the risk

**Types of Theft**:

- _Enterprise Data Theft_: proprietary business information
- _Personal Data Theft_: credit card number, SSN
- _Identity Theft_: use SSN and identity to open a credit card

#### Laws Protecting Privacy

- _HIPAA_ ~ health insurance portability & accountability act (1996)
  - confidentiality of health reports
- _Sarbanes-Oxley_ act of 2002 (Sarbox)
  - 
- _Gramm-Leach-Bliley_ act (GLBA)
  - Requires banks and financial institutions to alert their customers of policies
    and practices in reporting and disclosing customer info
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
  - Policies that force merchants to properly store their customer's credit card info,
    and to routinely test their systems
- State notification & Security Laws
  - California's Database Security Breach Notification act (2003)

#### Reasons for Widespread Vulnerabilities

- Large number of vulnerabilities
- End-of-life systems
- Lack of vendor support

#### Reasons it's difficult to defend

- Delays in security updating
- Increased speed of attacks
- Simplicity of attack tools

> Vulnerable business processes, also called business process compromise (BPC),
> occurs when an attacker manipulates commonplace actions that are routinely
> performed within an organization.

-----------------------------

## Cyber-Crime

Two types of cyber crime: one focuses on individuals, the other on enterprises & governments.

> Varies by funding & resources available to threat actors, whether originated by
> internal or external entities, and by their intent.

**Cyber-Terrorism**: Any premeditated, politically motivated attack against information,
computer systems, computer programs, and data.

- cause panic, provoke violence, ruin finances
- banking industry, military, power plants, air traffic control, water systems

> The most dangerous attackers attack the sustainability of life

**Script Kiddies**: Just motivated noobs. > 40% of attacks are by noobs.

- 13% no skill
- 28% little skill
- 44% moderate skill
- 15% high skill

**Hacktivist**: Soy-boy trying to make a statement

**Nation-State Actor**: James Bond of hacking, sponsored by a government

**Advanced Persistent Threat**: Multi-year campaign - a russian spy

> > 58% are inside jobs

**Open-Source Intelligence**: Automated attack software

--------------------------------

## Threat Actors

- _competitors_ - Pepsi vs. Coke
- _organized crime_ - online gambling scams
- _brokers_ - sells knowledge of vulnerabilities
- _cyber terrorists_ - attack power grids, etc.
