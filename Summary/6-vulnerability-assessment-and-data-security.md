Vulnerability Assessment and Data Security
==================================================

> A vulnerability assessment is a thorough and methodical evaluation of
> the security posture of the enterprise, examining the exposure to hackers,
> forces of nature, and any harmful entity

> _security posture_ - an approach, philosophy, or strategy regarding security

## Tools

- `netstat` - displays open ports and their processes
- `nmap` / `netcat` - network mapper
- `ifconfig` - set ip addresses per NIC
- `arp` - display and set ARP settings
- `tcpdump` - record network traffic for inspection

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Asset Identification

> Inventory of items with value, and their relative value;
> how critical is the asset, how much revenue it generates,
> how difficult is it to replace, and the impact if it is gone.

- people
- physical assets
- data
- hardware
- software

### Threat Evaluation

> List potential threats that come from threat agents

- threat modeling - attempt to understand attackers and their goal, via threat scenarios
- attack tree - potential attacks

### Vulnerability Appraisal

- determine current weakness
- take snapshot of current security
- catalog each vulnerability when viewing assets in light of threats

### Risk Management

- assess damage that would result from attack
- determine likelihood that vulnerability is exploited

### Risk Mitigation

- determine what to do about risks, and what should be tolerated

## Vulnerability Assessment Tools

- port scanners
- protocol analyzers / sniffers
- honeypots & honeynets - bait
- banner grabbing tools
- crackers
- command line tools
- exploitation framework - replicate attacks
- steganography

### Vulnerability scans

- _intrusive_ - when the scanner actually tries to change the state, to have more accuracy about the exploit
- _non-intrusive_ - just postulates on the active vulnerabilities, but doesn't exploit them. Useful for wide scans, so you don't have to re-image the servers
- _credentialed_ - given higher privilege - more accurate
- _non-credentialed_ - real-world scenario of outside threat actors
- _passive testing_ - target of the scanner is the system, not the security controls
- active (probes), passive (no probes), credentialed & non-credentialed
- can detect new systems added
- when an application is compromised
- when a port scanner is run
- which ports are ingress / egress
- network mapping scanner, wireless scanner, configuration compliance scanner

## Penetration Testing

> Vulnerability scanning, but instead of just identifying them, they're exploited

- blackbox, whitebox, graybox - amount of knowledge of system
- _active & passive_ reconnaissance
  - active may trigger alerts, and actually interacts with network devices & systems
  - passive simply uses information available, like knowing they adopted some software - packet sniffer
- _pivoting_ - using a compromised machine to infiltrate a network not previously accessible
- _initial exploitation_ - first, low-level vulnerability that's been non-destructively attacked; often involves ordinary user accounts
- _persistence_ - to maintain a presence over a long period of time - agents that stay connected to the attacker, malicious accounts, and replication
- _escalation of privilege_ - obtaining more access, potentially enabling the same access back to the original state. May use to attack log collections
  or other detection means

## Secure Methodology

- creating a security posture
- selecting and configuring controls
- hardening
- reporting

### Controls

- confidentiality - encryption, steganography, access controls
- integrity - hashing, digital signatures, certificates, nonrepudiation tools
- availability - redundancy, fault tolerance, patching
- safety - fencing and lighting, locks, CCTV, escape plans and routes, safety drills

> Some are for detection, some are for prevention

What is a higher priority when X happens - security or safety?

- fail-safe locks, vs. fail-open locks
