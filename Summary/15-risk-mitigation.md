Risk Mitigation
===================

- _Risk_ - situation that involves exposure to some type of danger
- _Managing Risk_ - To create a level of protection that mitigates the vulnerabilities to threats,
  and reduces potential consequences
  - Knowing what threats are being faced
  - Assessing those risks

## Threat Assessment

> A formal process of examining the seriousness of a potential threat, as well
> as the likelihood of it being carried out.

- should determine asset value, and relative worth of assets at risk

Types of threats:

- Environmental
- Man-Made
- Internal vs. External

Threat Categories:

- _Strategic_ - affects the long-term goals of the enterprise
- _Compliance_ - following, or not following, a regulation or standard
- _Financial_ - impact of financial decisions, or market factors
- _Operational_ - impacts daily business
- _Technical_ - affects IT systems / highly skilled fields
- _Managerial_ - related to the management

## Risk Assessment

### Testing

- tech should be tested to identify any vulnerabilities
- intrusive vulnerability scan - attempts to penetrate
- non-intrusive vulnerability scan - only uses available information to hypothesize
- pentest - exploit weaknesses
  - authorization should be obtained for legal protection, indemnification, and limit retaliation

### Change management

- methodology for making modifications & keeping track
- proper documentation
- all kinds of changes are recorded for IT systems

Two major changes that need proper documentation:

- System architecture
- file or document classification

Change Management Teams (CMT)

- body for overseeing changes
- composed of representatives from IT, network security, and upper management
- proposals must be approved by CMT
- review proposed changes
- ensure risk and impact of changes are well understood
- recommend approval, disapproval, deferral, or withdrawal
- communicate proposals to coworkers

### Privilege management

> Subject's access level, and the act of granting or revoking access

- privilege auditing

### Incident management

> Components required to identify, analyze, and contain incident

- Incident handling - planning, coordination, communications, and planning functions for resolution

### Risk calculations

two approaches:

- qualitative risk calculation - educated guess, figurative values
- quantitative risk calculation - divided into likelihood and impact

Risk likelihood:

- Mean Time Between Failure (BTBF)
- Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)
- Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)
- Failure In Time (FIT)
- Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) - historical data

Risk impact:

- Monetary loss associated with an asset â†’ amount of money lost
- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) - expected monetary loss every time a risk occurs
- Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) - expected monetary loss over one year

### Representing risk information

- Risk register - potential threats & associated risks
- Risk matrix - impact and likelihood

## Strategies for Reducing Risk

### Using Control Types

- Any device or process that's used to reduce risk
- Administrative Controls - ensuring policies and procedures are followed
- Technical Controls - security controls carried out or managed by devices

Subtypes:

- Deterrent controls
- Preventative controls
- Physical controls
- Detective controls
- Compensating controls
- Corrective controls

### Distributing Allocation

> "spreading" the risk

- _Transference_ - make a 3rd party responsible
- _Risk avoidance_ - do not engage in activity
- _Mitigation_ - address the risk by making it less serious

### Implementing Technology

- Risk is often introduced by human error
- Using tech can minimize these errors

#### Automation

> That which replaces human activity

- Scalability
- Elasticity (the opposite)
- Continuous monitoring

#### Images and templates

- Master image - pre-built with proper configurations
- Templates standardize content

#### Non-persistence tools

- "live" boot media
- revert to known state
- rollback to known configuration
- snapshots

## Practices for Reducing Risk

### Security Policies

- Consensus of judgement
- appropriate behaviors
- what tools and procedures are needed
- directives for HR
- if necessary to prosecute

> Must balance trust and control

Examples:

- Encryption policy
- Antivirus policy
- Database credentials coding
- Email
- Extranet
- Router security
- Server security
- VPN security
- Wireless comms
- _Acceptable Use Policy_

### Agreements

- Service Level Agreement (SLA) - services and responsibilities
- Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) - prearranged purchase between a government and contractor
- Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) - agreement between two or more
- Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA) - minimize security risks over network
- Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) - confidentiality
