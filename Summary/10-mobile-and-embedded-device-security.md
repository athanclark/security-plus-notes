Mobile and Embedded Device Security
============================================

## Statistics

- 68% of all health sector breeches were due to a lost or stolen cell phone
- 25% of all laptop theft is from unlocked cars
- 15% in airports and hotels
- 12% from restaurants

## Mobile

- Coverage area for cellular telephony in city - _hexagon_

Types of Device Support:

- _BYOD_ - bring your own device
- _COPE_ - corporate owned, personally enabled
- _CYOD_ - choose your own device, you still own it
- _VDI_ - virtual desktop infrastructure

### Mobile Device Management (MDM)

- _Mobile Application Management_ (MAM) - remote install of updates and software
- OEMs and wireless carriers don't like updating everything, becuase it wouldn't distinguish them
- Updates could conflict with their factory settings
- Why update when you could sell more?

## Embedded Systems

- IoT - some operated with AI
- Realtime operating systems
- susceptible to act as DDoS bots
- _Controller Area Network_ (CAN) - network of microcontrollers communicating without a central authority
- QR code or PIN on each device, using ECDH and TLS - Security 2 (S2) Framework

### _Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition_ (SCADA)

>  the essence of "smart" embedded components

- aka. Distributed Control System (DCS), Industrial Control System (ICS)
- likely involved when they control a physical process
- multiple components networked together
- historically isolated from network, now are integrated
- Stuxnet attack on Iran nuclear facilities

## Satcom

- _repeater_ - satellites that relay the same information at different frequencies
